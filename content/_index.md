I am Otis. This is a public facing collection of my current [projects](@/projects/_index.md).

I am interested in Games, UI and Physical Interfaces, Group Formation, Group Learning and Collaborative Worldbuilding.
I find myself drawn to things which embody Novelty, Efficiency, Autonomy (among other things).
I find meaning and enjoyment in creative collaboration.


* I am currently looking for contract work in Game Design, Game or Tools Programming, Level Design, or Content Creation roles.
* I am generally interested in collaborating with people who have shared interests or goals, if you have a project you want me to work on with you or want to talk about one of my projects get in touch!
