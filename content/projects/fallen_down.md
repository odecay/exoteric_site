This game was originally made over the 48 hours of the LD48 compo.  
The original submission is found [here](https://sitonapanotis.itch.io/fallen-down).
Most of the intended mechanics were cut due to time constraints of the jam, and the game was tabled.
Since then I have returned to the game and it is currently being reworked into [bullet_chasm](@/projects/bullet_chasm.md).

This song is meant to accompany gameplay.
