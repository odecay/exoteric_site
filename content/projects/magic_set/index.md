A puzzle game based on projected set pattern matching. Made in Rust + Bevy.

This game is in a very early state of development. Currently I am experimenting with selection mechanics as well as tile movement.

To play click in frame, WASD keys move, Spacebar begins a selection, make matches of 3 tiles, all of the same or different colors and same or different shapes to clear the board.

<script type="module">
  import init from './magic_set.js'
  init()
</script>
