# Design Intent
The design of this game was after the fact influenced by
[1000 Blank White Cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000_Blank_White_Cards)

Here is a selection of cards made before the first playtest.
This version was played digitally and mostly synchronously in one play session using a network share directory in which players exchanged cards.
This set of cards played on the movement and positioning of cards within players' Active and Inactive collections.
